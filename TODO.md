# TODO List

1. Stock Pages: This is assigned to Matt
2. Dashboard: This is assigned to Tanav4
3. Search Bar: The search bar will go through either a public txt or we axios a json or txt file of yahoo stock tickers, preferably axios. When a user types, there should be a dropdown of a maximum 5-10 suggestions of the closest matching tickers, on click, it should REDIRECT to the stock route: This is assigned to no one at the moment
4. AJAX form requirement, THE BUY AND SELL BUTTONS: This is assigned to no one at the moment

We need to review the rubric for the project to make sure we are getting all that stuff checked off, if someone finds stuff missing that we haven't addressed, please let it be known on discord, so we could figure it out, we dont really have that much time.
