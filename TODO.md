# TODO List

1. Stock Pages: This is assigned to Matt -> **Buy and sell buttons**
2. Dashboard: This is assigned to Tanav -> **Buy and sell buttons**
3. AJAX form requirement, THE BUY AND SELL BUTTONS: This is assigned to no one at the moment

We need to review the rubric for the project to make sure we are getting all that stuff checked off, if someone finds stuff missing that we haven't addressed, please let it be known on discord, so we could figure it out, we dont really have that much time.
