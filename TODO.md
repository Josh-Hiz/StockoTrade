# TODO List

1. StockPages: This is assigned to Matt
2. Dashboard: This is assigned to Tanav4
3. HTML done need to do client side js - Search bar: we need a search bar for stock tickers, we need this to use client side javascript, maybe even AJAX
4. AJAX form requirement: the buy and sell buttons

We need to review the rubric for the project to make sure we are getting all that stuff checked off, if someone finds stuff missing that we haven't addressed, please let it be known on discord, so we could figure it out, we dont really have that much time.
