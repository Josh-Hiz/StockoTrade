# TODO List

1. DONE - Someone do the tasks/seed.js file please, the instructions are in comments on the file, shouldn't take long, maybe Hargun can do this 
2. StockPages: This is assigned to Matt
3. Dashboard: This is assigned to Tanav
4. HTML done need to do client side js - Search bar: we need a search bar for stock tickers, we need this to use client side javascript, maybe even AJAX
5. when you back arrow from user dashboard to login, you get an error when you try to login, prob because of cookies

We need to review the rubric for the project to make sure we are getting all that stuff checked off, if someone finds stuff missing that we haven't addressed, please let it be known on discord, so we could figure it out, we dont really have that much time.
